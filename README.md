# Dominic and Natalia's HTTP Project

### Who are we?
We are Natalia and Dominic, students on Founders & Coders’ FAC26 Bootcamp cohort.

### What is the project?
We have been entrusted to build an app on a theme of our choice that queries at least two APIs, and uses the results to update the DOM. There should be a way for the user to search, filter, or sort data drawn from the APIs.

### Our project
We are constructing an app that will draw statistics from two different APIs on countries around the world. The statistics will include information on each country’s capital city, area size, languages, currency, geographical position, GDP, and numerous other variables.

- The user will be able to type in the name of a country in a Search bar, and the page will then be populated with data relating to that specific country
- The name of the country will be displayed, together with its flag and offical name
- There will be a table on the page containing the data
- There will be a link to the country in Google Maps and Open Street Map
- The current weather in that country will be displayed
