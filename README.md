# Dominic and Natalia's HTTP Project: World GeoData


### Our project
This app, called World GeoData, draws statistics from two different APIs on countries around the world. The statistics includes information on each countryâ€™s capital city, area size, languages, currency, geographical position, and numerous other variables.<br>
See in action https://fac26.github.io/Dominic_Natalia_http/

- The user will be able to type in the name of a country in a Search bar, and the page will then be populated with data relating to that specific country
- The name of the country is displayed, together with its flag and offical name
- If two countries share roughly the same name - for example, there are two countries called the Congo, and two called Korea - an option bar will come up listing both; the user has to choose one of the two
- There is a link to the country in Google Maps and Open Street Map
- The current weather in that country is displayed

#### Accessibility Criteria:
